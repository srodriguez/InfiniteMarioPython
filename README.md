# Infinite Mario Server and Agent Samples

This is a refactor of the original repository [InfiniteMarioPython](https://github.com/mchldann/InfiniteMarioPython)

# Python Agent for Infinite Mario

To launch a Python-based agent, first you need to start Infinite Mario in server mode, then run the agent's Python script.

## Running the Infinite Mario server from Eclipse

Steps to get running:
* Download this repo.
* Install Eclipse. I've tested the instructions with this version:

* Open the project in Eclipse via File -> Open Projects from File System... Just select the main folder (InfiniteMarioPython), not the 'src' subdirectory or anything else.
* Run the server from Eclipse by specifying '-server on' in the program arguments. One issue I had is that the default working directory (in the second screenshot below) was somehow set incorrectly. Overriding it by clicking *Other* and specifying the "classes" subdirectory solved the problem.

## Installing the Python Dependencies via Anaconda and pip

```
conda create -n py36 python=3.6
conda activate py36
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install future
pip install matplotlib
pip install opencv-python
pip install prettytable
```

## Running the agent's Python script

* Open a terminal in the 'src' directory.
* Activate a Python 2 conda environment if necessary.
* ```python python/competition/ipymario.py ```
* This should launch the custom 'MichaelAgent' I've created that randomly runs left and right.

Press 'v' in the Mario window that appears to toggle visualisation. (See src/ch/idsia/ai/agents/human/CheaterKeyboardAgent.java) for a list of all the keyboard instructions.
